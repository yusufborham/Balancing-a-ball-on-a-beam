# Balancing Ball on Beam  

This repository contains the implementation of a **Balancing Ball on Beam** project, developed as part of my coursework in **Automatic Control** at the Faculty of Engineering.  

## Overview  
The project aims to balance a ball on a beam by controlling the beam's angle through a servo motor. The system relies on a **PID controller** for precise position control, with real-time feedback provided by a distance sensor.  

## Features  
- **Hardware Components**:  
  - **Arduino Uno**: Serves as the main microcontroller.  
  - **VL53L1X Distance Sensor**: Measures the ball's position with high accuracy.  
  - **Servo Motor**: Adjusts the beam's angle to balance the ball.  
- **Control System**:  
  - Implemented a **PID controller** for stability and responsiveness.  
  - Tuned parameters to achieve minimal overshoot and steady-state error.  
- **Simulation Tools**:  
  - Developed a **Simulink model** to analyze system behavior and validate the control strategy.  
  - Wrote **MATLAB code** for simulation to ensure accuracy before hardware deployment.  

## Files Included  
- Simulink model for system dynamics and PID control.  
- MATLAB code for system simulation and analysis.  
- Arduino code for real-time control of the system.
- Schematic for the circuit 
- 3d files for the project

## Applications  
This project demonstrates the application of control theory in dynamic systems, with potential uses in automation and robotics.
