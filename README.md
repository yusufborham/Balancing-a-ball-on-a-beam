# Balancing a ball on a beam
{ This project is trying to balance a ball on a beam .It is done using a PID controller
 A model based on the dynamics of the system is done on simulink
 A matlab code also is added which simulates the beam and the ball position
 code for the arduino is avaialble and also the schematic }
 ---
## Components used are :
1) Vl0531X for measuring distances
2) Metal Gear Servo Motor
3) Buck converter to supply the servo with 6 volts
4) Arduino Uno the brain of the system
